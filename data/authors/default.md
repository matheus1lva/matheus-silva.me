# Matheus Silva - About

## Who am i

I'm a open source oriented developer, i tend to whatever i do think about others first and think if anything that can be done can be open sourced. Since the beginning this made me grow so much! I was capable of learning best practices in all scenarios, new tools, new ways of coding! Everything! The way that a product and a project should grow is end user first!

## Side interests

Apart from tech i'm also into crypto, including defi, yield farm, and everything related to blockchains! I'm currently learning react-native and solidty/web3js side by side on a side projetct i'm developing! This is being done in cooperation with a friend designer! We aim to deliver some really good UX and a product that actually works. We used our own needs and some friends opinions to shape up the interactions and features!
