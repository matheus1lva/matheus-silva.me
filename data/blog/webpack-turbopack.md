description: What is the real difference of webpack versus turbopack?
---

Webpack and TurboPack are two popular JavaScript module bundlers used in modern web development. While both have a similar goal of bundling JavaScript code into a single file for efficient delivery, there are differences in their approach and capabilities. In this blog post, we will compare and contrast webpack and TurboPack to help you make an informed decision on which to use for your next project.

# Webpack

Webpack is a module bundler that has been around since 2012 and has become the de facto standard for web development. It offers a wide range of features, including code splitting, tree shaking, hot module replacement, and more. Webpack is highly configurable and can be extended with plugins, which makes it suitable for complex projects.

One of the primary benefits of webpack is its ability to handle non-JavaScript assets, such as CSS, images, and fonts, through loaders. This allows developers to bundle all of the assets required for a web page into a single file, improving performance and reducing the number of requests made to the server. Additionally, webpack has a vast ecosystem of plugins and integrations with other tools, making it a popular choice for modern web development.

# TurboPack

TurboPack is a relatively new module bundler that was released in 2021. It was created with the goal of being faster than webpack while still offering similar capabilities. TurboPack leverages the V8 engine's built-in JavaScript parser to avoid the overhead of transpiling and parsing code, resulting in faster builds.

In addition to its speed, TurboPack offers a simpler configuration compared to webpack. It relies on conventions and defaults to make it easier for developers to get started quickly without having to spend time configuring their project. TurboPack also has built-in support for non-JavaScript assets, similar to webpack, allowing developers to bundle all required assets into a single file.

# Comparison

The primary difference between webpack and TurboPack is their approach to module bundling. Webpack is highly configurable and offers a vast ecosystem of plugins and integrations, which make it suitable for complex projects with specific requirements. TurboPack, on the other hand, offers a simpler and faster approach, making it ideal for smaller projects or developers who value speed and simplicity.

Both webpack and TurboPack can handle non-JavaScript assets, but webpack's extensive ecosystem of loaders and plugins gives it an edge when it comes to handling complex asset types. TurboPack's use of the V8 engine's built-in JavaScript parser makes it faster than webpack, but it may not be as optimized for handling complex configurations or more niche use cases.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, webpack and TurboPack are both excellent module bundlers, each with its strengths and weaknesses. If you are working on a complex project with specific requirements and need a highly configurable bundler with a vast ecosystem of plugins, then webpack may be the best choice. On the other hand, if you value speed and simplicity and are working on a smaller project, then TurboPack is a good option. Ultimately, the decision of which bundler to use will depend on your project's specific needs, and it's worth evaluating both options before making a decision.
